# DeleF-o-launcher
A minecraft launcher for a hardcoded purpose, utilizing python minecraft-launcher-lib and TKinter libraries
Pulls minecraft files from mojang, mod loaders from their respective repository and mods and resourcepacks from a [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1S3amaG1Ouls9E081Eb_ZWnaYSByum7ai).  It has been found that downloading an entire .zip from google and then unpacking it turns out faster than puliing mods one by one. And as mods do not take that much space, it has been decided to leave this not-so-elegant solution in. There are many inconsistacies and instances of hardcoding and bad language in the projet, but improvemts will be underway.
